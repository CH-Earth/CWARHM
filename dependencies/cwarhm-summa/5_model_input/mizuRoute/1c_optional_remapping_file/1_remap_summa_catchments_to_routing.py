# Create SUMMA-to-mizuRoute catchment remapping file
# Creates a remap `.nc` file for cases where the routing catchments are different from the catchments used to run SUMMA. While mizuRoute is able to perform routing from grid-based outputs, SUMMA does not produce these and the code here is not setup to work with gridded model outputs.
#
# **_This code assumes routing occurs at the GRU level of SUMMA outputs. SUMMA-HRU-level routing is not supported._**
