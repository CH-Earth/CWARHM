# Initial conditions file
Makes an initial conditions file with basic assumptions. The initial conditions or state file contains a number of modeling options. The state file is an `.nc` file with dimensions `nSoil`, `nSnow`, `midSoil`, `midToto`, `ifcToto` and `scalarv`. See: https://summa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input_output/SUMMA_input/#initial-conditions-restart-or-state-file

State parameters are set at hard-coded values as follows:

SUMMA has built-in capability to save the model states at a given time step. This behaviour is controlled by runtime argument `-r` (for "restart") and parameter `year`, `month`, `day` or `end`. Runs can be restarted from such a file by changing the name of the `initConditionFile` entry in `fileManager.txt`. Such files can also form the basis for a more appropriate initial conditions file when they result from long runs. This initial long run can be treated as a model warm-up period and the restart file can be used as an approximation of the slowly changing model states. The folder `0_tools` that is part of this repository contains a script that can be used to strip the snow layers from a restart file if desired.
