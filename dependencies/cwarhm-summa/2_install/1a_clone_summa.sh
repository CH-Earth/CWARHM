# Script to clone SUMMA

# --- Settings
# Find the line with the GitHub url
setting_line=$(grep -m 1 "^github_summa" ../0_control_files/control_active.txt) # -m 1 ensures we only return the top-most result. This is needed because variable names are sometimes used in comments in later lines

# Extract the url
github_url=$(echo ${setting_line##*|}) # remove the part that ends at "|"
github_url=$(echo ${github_url%%#*}) # remove the part starting at '#'; does nothing if no '#' is present

# Find the line with the destination path
dest_line=$(grep -m 1 "^install_path_summa" ../0_control_files/control_active.txt) 

# Extract the path
summa_path=$(echo ${dest_line##*|})
