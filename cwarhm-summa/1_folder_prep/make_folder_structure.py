SUMMA workflow: make folder structure
Makes the initial folder structure for a given control file. All other files in the workflow will look for the file `control_active.txt` during their execution. This script:

1. Copies the specified control file into `control_active.txt`;
2. Prepares a folder structure using the settings in `control_active.txt`.
3. Creates a copy of itself to be stored in the new folder structure.

The destination folders are referred to as "domain folders".
